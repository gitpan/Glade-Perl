Revision history for Perl module Glade::PerlGenerate development branch.

Fri Oct 20 01:19:45 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.57
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkPixmap() fixed to use project logo as default rather
    than crash in flames if no pixmap is specified.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GnomePixmap() now also uses project logo as default
  - PerlUI->Widget_from_Proto() fixed to report missing constructors 
    and properties correctly rather than die()ing.
  - $PerlUI::perl_gtk_depends updated to ignore gnome-db widgets until
    Gtk::Perl can handle them.
  - PerlRun->full_Path() fixed to remove any /../ parts in the filename
    so that the returned full path is exact and unique if possible.
  - PerlGenerate pod corrected and improved.
  - COPYING file changed to invite commercial users to make a donation to 
    perl.org (donors@perlmongers.org) rather than me ;-> I borrowed the 
    COPYING file from a CPAN module and was embarrassed to reread it when
    Scott Barninger of Piedmont Airlines accepted the invitation!
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to pack Gtk::PixmapMenuItem
    submenus correctly.
  - Glade-Perl.spec file borrowed from Gtk-Perl dist to allow RPM builds.
    This doesn't work yet - but if you can help ...
  - PerlSource amended to also write a method app_run() to ProjectSIGS.pm
    and Project.pm (first time) for any user UI initialisation code.
  - PerlGUIGtk->new_GtkButton() now caters for 'relief' (in Glade-0.5.10)
  - PerlGUIGtk->new_GtkToggleButton() now caters for 'relief' (as above)
  - Null source_directory now generates source in project directory (and
    not in ./src) to match the actions of Glade 0.5.11.
  - New error message if there are minus signs/spaces/dots in signal handler 
    names - they are substituted by _MINUS_/_SPACE_/_DOT_. This is really 
    to deal with the new (Glade 0.5.10) default widget names for combo_box
    entry widgets (eg combo-entry1 and handler on_combo-entry1_activate)
  - Changelog - this file reduced to versions >= 0.50. (Older on website)
  - If the user option <style> includes 'split' the app and signal handler
    modules will be generated with each class in its own file. See the
    test example to see how this works.
  - test.pl extended to test both the split base classes and the subclass.
  
Wed Apr 19 02:28:58 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.56 - embarassment release
  - Makefile.PL unchanged so that it will install all the modules correctly.
  
Wed Apr 19 02:28:58 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.55
  - New FAQ about building Unicode::String for perl 5.6
  - PerlXML->Proto_from_XML_Parser_Tree() changed to cancel the use of 
    encodings if Unicode::String is not available. You should not need to
    install Unicode::String now unless you use european characters.
  - Documentation/Gtk-Perl-Docs.html tidied and Stephen Wilhelm's Gtk-Perl
    tutorial http://personal.riverusers.com/~swilhelm/perlgtk/tutorial/
    now pushed as the best starting point for learning Gtk-Perl.
  
Sun Apr 16 00:07:26 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.54
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() fixed to use gnome_app_docked_item() and
    not construct our own widgets and containers (Damon's ideas)
    Also now better handles notebooks as children of Gnome Dialogs
  - PerlGenerate->unused_elements() name now check_for_unused_elements()
  - PerlUI->new_signal() changed 'Missing signal handler' message to 
    verbose level 4 so that verbose => 2 gives more compact diagnostics. 
    Skeleton signal handlers are still generated in ProjectSIGS.pm for you 
    to copy somewhere and edit as before.
  - Makefile.PL fixed to use the correct module name (Glade-Perl)
  - PerlSource->write_LIBGLADE() fixed to produce working signal handlers.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() changed to use the new bindings in
    Gtk-Perl (CVS 20000410) that actually construct a PixmapMenuItem 
    instead of just a Gtk::MenuItem. Earlier versions of Gtk-Perl will now
    construct Gtk::MenuItem explicitly.
    
Tue Apr 11 15:45:29 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.53
  - New FAQ about character encodings.
  - PerlProject two new user options to handle character encodings.
    <glade_encoding> to specify the Glade file character encoding.
    <glade2perl_encoding> to specify the glade2perl.xml project options 
    file character encoding (defaults to glade_encoding).
  - PerlXML->QuoteXMLChars() characters x80-xff not now encoded so project
    options are saved without re-encoding eg european characters.
  - PerlXML->save_options() extra declaration line with character encoding
    eg <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> written to head of file.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkAccelLabel() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkLabel() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkCheckButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkToggleButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkCheckMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() much simplified and underlines 
    now parsed correctly.
  - Perl* all packages now have an empty DESTROY method to keep perl 5.006
    happy when it is running cleanup with warnings enabled.
  - PerlSource->perl_AUTOLOAD_top, perl_SUBCLASS_top, perl_LIBGLADE_top
    amended to write empty DESTROY() subs to generated classes (see above)
  - PerlGenerate documentation - perldoc (and manpage) corrected and 
    improved to include all user options.
  
Fri Mar 31 16:44:38 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.52
  - PerlSource->check_gettext_strings() and write_gettext_strings() are
    two new subs to help you spot missing translations and write a .pot file
  - PerlRun->D_(), S_() moved to to PerlSource to remove run-time pollution.
  - PerlSource->_() overrides PerlRun->_()  for gettext string checking.
  - PerlSource added some commented lines to the generated sources to do the 
    gettext string checking for the user.
  - PerlSource->perl_LIBGLADE_top() added a file check and better 
    explanation if the Glade file is missing in the generated run() sub.
  - ppo/Glade-Perl.pot I have found some more strings to be translated :(
  - PerlSource all subs now have '} # End of sub %name' as last line
  - PerlUI->set_widget_properites() finally implemented set_events() and
    set_extension_events() generation.
  - PerlGenerate->Form_from_Glade_file() and Form_from_XML() amended to 
    create proto to allow multiple accelerators for a widget.
  - Perl* all subs that use Glade-Perl user options improved. The defaults 
    are now more correctly determined and fewer options should be saved in 
    the project_options file 
  - PerlGenerate->Form_from_XML() fixed to do what it should again.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkVPaned() fixed to supply a default position. This 
    seems to be caused because Glade-0.5.7 doesn't save all default values.
    Most other defaults also now supplied in case of further changes.
    Thanks to Ned Konz <ned@bike-nomad.com> for the report
  - Popup menus with keyboard accelerators and tooltips generated correctly
    Thanks to Skywolf Lu <skywolf@ms21.hinet.net> for the report
  - PerlGenerate->unused_widgets() now only warns (verbose >= 4) when C++
    specific widget properties are encountered (they are currently ignored).
    Thanks to Robert Schwebel <robert@schwebel.de> for the report.
    
Thu Mar  2 04:30:08 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.51
  - PerlUI testing source comments removed from generated code
  - PerlRun->create_image() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GnomeAbout() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GnomePixmap() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
    so now there should be no hard-coded paths in the generated code :)
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to add() Gtk::Text objects to a
    Gtk::ScrolledWindow correctly (like Gtk::CTree or Gtk::CList).
    Thanks to Frank de Lange for an excellent report and suggestions.
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() amended to deal with Gnome::Dialogs
  - PerlUIExtra->frig_Gnome_Dialog_buttons() to add Gnome::Dialog buttons
    and accelerators in a better way (unstandard in Glade-Perl though :( )
    This works for all Gnome Dialogs (MessageBox, PropertyBox, Dialog)
    but only with gnome-perl CVS after 20000301.
  - PerlRun->load_translations() and mo_format_value() _(), S_() and D_() 
    new subs to implement gettext support for apps, source and diagnostics. 
  - PerlUI* generate gettext code for all text fields in widgets.
  - PerlSource->perl_AUTOLOAD_top() now generates load_translation() call 
  - All modules diagnostics messages converted to sprintf-like format so
    that diag_print can translate them.
  - PerlProject->diag_print() became diag_ref_print() and new diag_print()
    written for i18n of Glade-Perl. You can now specify the language for
    diagnostics, the language for the source (comments) and the generated 
    apps can use their own languages! 
    All defaults are $ENV{'LANG'} but diagnostics and source languages can 
    be overridden in the site, user or Project.glade2perl.xml options files
    
Thu Feb 24 22:57:47 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.50 embarassment release
  - PerlUiExtra->new_GtkPixMeneuItem() fixes to string quoting
