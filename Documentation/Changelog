Revision history for Perl module Glade::PerlGenerate development branch.
Wed Apr 19 02:28:58 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.55
  - New FAQ about building Unicode::String for perl 5.6
  - PerlXML->Proto_from_XML_Parser_Tree() changed to cancel the use of 
    encodings if Unicode::String is not available. You should not need to
    install Unicode::String now unless you use european characters.
  - Documentation/Gtk-Perl-Docs.html tidied and Stephen Wilhelm's Gtk-Perl
    tutorial http://personal.riverusers.com/~swilhelm/perlgtk/tutorial/
    now pushed as the best starting point for learning Gtk-Perl.
  
Sun Apr 16 00:07:26 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.54
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() fixed to use gnome_app_docked_item() and
    not construct our own widgets and containers (Damon's ideas)
    Also now better handles notebooks as children of Gnome Dialogs
  - PerlGenerate->unused_elements() name now check_for_unused_elements()
  - PerlUI->new_signal() changed 'Missing signal handler' message to 
    verbose level 4 so that verbose => 2 gives more compact diagnostics. 
    Skeleton signal handlers are still generated in ProjectSIGS.pm for you 
    to copy somewhere and edit as before.
  - Makefile.PL fixed to use the correct module name (Glade-Perl)
  - PerlSource->write_LIBGLADE() fixed to produce working signal handlers.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() changed to use the new bindings in
    Gtk-Perl (CVS 20000410) that actually construct a PixmapMenuItem 
    instead of just a Gtk::MenuItem. Earlier versions of Gtk-Perl will now
    construct Gtk::MenuItem explicitly.
    
Tue Apr 11 15:45:29 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.53
  - New FAQ about character encodings.
  - PerlProject two new user options to handle character encodings.
    <glade_encoding> to specify the Glade file character encoding.
    <glade2perl_encoding> to specify the glade2perl.xml project options 
    file character encoding (defaults to glade_encoding).
  - PerlXML->QuoteXMLChars() characters x80-xff not now encoded so project
    options are saved without re-encoding eg european characters.
  - PerlXML->save_options() extra declaration line with character encoding
    eg <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> written to head of file.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkAccelLabel() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkLabel() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkCheckButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkToggleButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkCheckMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() much simplified and underlines 
    now parsed correctly.
  - Perl* all packages now have an empty DESTROY method to keep perl 5.006
    happy when it is running cleanup with warnings enabled.
  - PerlSource->perl_AUTOLOAD_top, perl_SUBCLASS_top, perl_LIBGLADE_top
    amended to write empty DESTROY() subs to generated classes (see above)
  - PerlGenerate documentation - perldoc (and manpage) corrected and 
    improved to include all user options.
  
Fri Mar 31 16:44:38 BST 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.52
  - PerlSource->check_gettext_strings() and write_gettext_strings() are
    two new subs to help you spot missing translations and write a .pot file
  - PerlRun->D_(), S_() moved to to PerlSource to remove run-time pollution.
  - PerlSource->_() overrides PerlRun->_()  for gettext string checking.
  - PerlSource added some commented lines to the generated sources to do the 
    gettext string checking for the user.
  - PerlSource->perl_LIBGLADE_top() added a file check and better 
    explanation if the Glade file is missing in the generated run() sub.
  - ppo/Glade-Perl.pot I have found some more strings to be translated :(
  - PerlSource all subs now have '} # End of sub %name' as last line
  - PerlUI->set_widget_properites() finally implemented set_events() and
    set_extension_events() generation.
  - PerlGenerate->Form_from_Glade_file() and Form_from_XML() amended to 
    create proto to allow multiple accelerators for a widget.
  - Perl* all subs that use Glade-Perl user options improved. The defaults 
    are now more correctly determined and fewer options should be saved in 
    the project_options file 
  - PerlGenerate->Form_from_XML() fixed to do what it should again.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkVPaned() fixed to supply a default position. This 
    seems to be caused because Glade-0.5.7 doesn't save all default values.
    Most other defaults also now supplied in case of further changes.
    Thanks to Ned Konz <ned@bike-nomad.com> for the report
  - Popup menus with keyboard accelerators and tooltips generated correctly
    Thanks to Skywolf Lu <skywolf@ms21.hinet.net> for the report
  - PerlGenerate->unused_widgets() now only warns (verbose >= 4) when C++
    specific widget properties are encountered (they are currently ignored).
    Thanks to Robert Schwebel <robert@schwebel.de> for the report.
    
Thu Mar  2 04:30:08 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.51
  - PerlUI testing source comments removed from generated code
  - PerlRun->create_image() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GnomeAbout() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GnomePixmap() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
    so now there should be no hard-coded paths in the generated code :)
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to add() Gtk::Text objects to a
    Gtk::ScrolledWindow correctly (like Gtk::CTree or Gtk::CList).
    Thanks to Frank de Lange for an excellent report and suggestions.
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() amended to deal with Gnome::Dialogs
  - PerlUIExtra->frig_Gnome_Dialog_buttons() to add Gnome::Dialog buttons
    and accelerators in a better way (unstandard in Glade-Perl though :( )
    This works for all Gnome Dialogs (MessageBox, PropertyBox, Dialog)
    but only with gnome-perl CVS after 20000301.
  - PerlRun->load_translations() and mo_format_value() _(), S_() and D_() 
    new subs to implement gettext support for apps, source and diagnostics. 
  - PerlUI* generate gettext code for all text fields in widgets.
  - PerlSource->perl_AUTOLOAD_top() now generates load_translation() call 
  - All modules diagnostics messages converted to sprintf-like format so
    that diag_print can translate them.
  - PerlProject->diag_print() became diag_ref_print() and new diag_print()
    written for i18n of Glade-Perl. You can now specify the language for
    diagnostics, the language for the source (comments) and the generated 
    apps can use their own languages! 
    All defaults are $ENV{'LANG'} but diagnostics and source languages can 
    be overridden in the site, user or Project.glade2perl.xml options files
    
Thu Feb 24 22:57:47 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.50 embarassment release
  - PerlUiExtra->new_GtkPixMeneuItem() fixes to string quoting
  
Thu Feb 24 22:57:47 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.49
  - PerlSource - some more diagnosticas and write_LIBGLADE() improved
  - PerlRun->create_pixmap() changed to look relative to current dir
  - PerlRun::pixmaps_directory new global to hold pixmaps directory for all
    references to pixmaps. Set this once in your app to relocate modules.
  - Example application updated, simplified and made clearer.
  - PerlUI->use_par() all apostrophes in returned text now backslash escaped.
  - PerlRun->missing_handler() message corrected.
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() and PerlGtk->new_GtkNotebook() amended to
    use a work structure rather than a single set of variables to keep track
    of notebook pages/tabs so that a notebook can be constructed on another 
    notebook's page. Thanks to Frank de Lange for finding this bug.
  - PerlUI->Widget_from_Proto() amended to construct hierarchical hashes of
    hashes to reference the widgets by form structure.
  - glade2perl regexp fixed to handle 'funny' project file names
  - PerlProject->use_Glade_Project() spaces, minuses and dots removed from 
    project name so that we end up with valid package names
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkMenubar() shadow_type new default 'out' (Glade-0.5.6)
  - Documentation/Gtk-Perl-Docs.html new file updated with details of of the 
    new gtk-perl-list@redhat.com and converted from .txt to HTML file.
  - Some changes to improve the LIBGLADE module code generation
  - PerlUI->new_signal() fixed to check for LIBGLADE type use_modules
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() fixed to handle toolbar buttons without
    icons or pixmaps. Now they are added just with the text. Code tidied too.
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() error reported for Gnome stock pixmaps in
    a non-Gnome project but added as text-only rather than failing.
  - PerlSource->perl_signal_handler() new sub to generate signal handlers in
    a fairly standard format.
  - Many widget names single quoted in Glade-Perl so 'funny' names don't fail.
  
Mon Feb 14 18:45:48 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.48
  - Makefile.PL extended to check for required perl modules and to install
    Example/glade2perl. Also customises call to pod2man to quote us as the
    origin (pod2man is not Y2K compliant! check the date :)
  - PerlGenerate->Form_from_Pad_Proto() and PerlSource->perl_SUBCLASS_header
    fixed to handle null source_directory and pixmaps_directory project 
    options for Glade-0.5.6 (defaulting to ./src and ./pixmaps).
  - Example/glade2perl amended to handle any Glade file suffix properly.
  - PerlSource changed to generate correct about boxes (doesn't allow_grow)
  - PerlUI->use_par() tidied a little
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuitem() updated to use new lookup subs to
    handle the Gnome UIINFO type Gtk::PixmapMenuItems. Work on underlines
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkMenuItem some work to handle underline accelerators.
  - PerlUIGtk->lookup() and PerlUIExtra->lookup() new subs to lookup or 
    synthesise the Gtk/Gnome enums
  - PerlProject->use_Glade_project() amended to read/store the logo file in 
    the project.glade2perl.xml options file for later user hand editing.
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() and PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed 
    to append a space before buttons with new group set.
  - PerlUI->new_signal() eval amended to quote the signal name to allow the
    use of 'funny' characters in handler names and so that signal handlers 
    are searched for in the class that instantiates the UI. This makes the 
    code much more flexible and useful - for instance perl scripts (package 
    main) also can new() and show() the UI and expect the signal handlers to 
    connect.
    Thanks to Robert Schwebel for ideas and testing.
  - I have removed all use English; calls and renamed associated system vars.
  - PerlSource->write_SUBCLASS() and write_LIBGLADE() added some blank lines
    and ' # End of sub $handler' at end of each generated handler
  - All widget constructors should now generate numeric args unquoted.
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkVButtonBox() and new_HButtonBox() now generates code
    for set_child_ipadding()
  - PerlUIGtk->new_HPaned() and new_VPaned() now set_postion()
  - PerlGenerate->own_logo() to return our logo. 
    Our logo written to pixmaps directory on first run for this project
  - PerlSource reorganised and code generation simplified so that we now
    generate ProjectUI.pm and ProjectSIGS.pm and Project.pm for the user
    to edit and a subclass of it called SubProject.pm. The last two files 
    are only written if they are missing (ie first time through) so you are 
    safe to edit them in situ and copy-paste new handlers from the generated 
    ProjectSIGS.pm file.
    Thanks to Stas Bekman for ideas.
  - PerlProject and PerlGenerate altered to simlify the project, options and
    glade file structure.
    
Wed Jan 19 17:12:54 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.47
  - PerlRun->message_box() amended to allow an entry field for a question_box.
  - PerlUI->new_from_child_name(), PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioButton() and 
    PerlUIGtk->new_GtkToggleButton() fixed to build correctly when child_name 
    is specified even though Glade doesn't  distinguish between GtkButton,
    GtkRadioButton and GtkToggleButton properly. Thanks to
    jes@presto.med.upenn.edu for pointing this out.    
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioButton() changed to use an existing rb_group widget
    and not keep updating the rb_group with new widget (pointless behaviour)
  - PerlUI->use_par amended to report any missing GNOMEUIINFO nicknames. This 
    will not work correctly until Gtk-Perl implements the GNOMEUIINFO stuff :(
    For the moment omit any menu items that are reported as missing. Thanks
    to Curt Johnson <cjohnson@arrayservices.com> for this report.
  - PerlUI->set_window_properties() amended to use 'default_width' or
    'default_height' properties if present.
  
Tue Jan  4 03:38:01 GMT 2000 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.46
  - Added check for Gnome::Stock if allow_gnome is set
  - PerlUI->get_versions() now caters for CPAN versions interspersed with CVS
    dates so that versioning works correctly.
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() will generate 'pack_expand' for Gtk-Perl
    versions before CPAN 0.7000 (CVS 20000102) as before.
      
Thu Dec 30 00:55:33 GMT 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.45
  - All uses of @ARG replaced by the short form @_ to allow perl 5.005 to 
    work in all cases (was a problem for perl installations in $HOME)
    Thanks to  Eric Richardson <eric@gospelcom.net> for this solution.
  - PerlUI->set_window_properties changed to generate set_default_size()
    instead of set_usize() following Havoc's comments on gtk-list. Also a 
    new warning if a toplevel window x, y (uposition) are specified in 
    Glade file.
  - PerlUI->set_window_properties() changed to use set_policy instead of
    allow_shrink(), allow_grow(), auto_shrink() setters.
  - PerlRun->message_box() changed for same reasons.
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget doesn't check the Gtk::Window->type() now
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget changed for Gtk::Packer->add_defaults() to 
    supply 'expand' and not 'pack_expand' as before.
    
Fri Dec 12 16:36:36 GMT 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.44
  - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() now doesn't warn about missing tooltips 
    for GtkLabel or GtkCombo in toolbars
  - PerlSource->write_SUBCLASS() now creates skeleton signal handlers for 
    every missing handler in every form.
  - Some efficiency improvements
  - PerlSource skeleton signal handlers generated with extra argument $event.
  - PerlSource a new module is now generated to use libglade to construct the 
    UI and with skeleton signal handlers with appropriate args.
  - PerlProject fixed bug reported by Heiko.Klein@ikp.uni-koeln.de where gnome
    version was checked even when gnome support was not requested - doh!
    
Wed Nov 10 20:33:55 GMT 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.43
  - PerlUIGtk->newGtkButton() bug fixed to work around changes since vanilla
    Gtk-Perl (0.6123). It now creates a normal button with the stock button
    text (eg 'Button_Ok') if your Gtk-Perl can't do Gnome::Stock->button
    instead of just dying as it used to.
  
Wed Nov 10 00:59:38 GMT 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.42
  - Fixed to 'use Gnome;' now. This is vital for Gtk-Perl CVS after 19991029
  - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkMenuBar() allows null shadow_type (old Glade XML)
  - PerlProject->get_versions() now dies if your libs don't at least meet the
    MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
  - PerlUIExtra->new_GnomeAnimator() new widget implemented (first appeared 
    in Glade 0.5.4)    
  - New FAQ about failing to build Gnome::Stock buttons.  
  - PerlProject->save_options() and use_Glade_Project() fixed to save the value
    of <allow_gnome> correctly

Tue Nov  2 02:20:00 GMT 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
  - Version 0.41
  - PerlRun->create_pixmap() updated to use new Gtk-Perl bindings if available
  - PerlSource->write_UI() stripped from PerlGenerate->Form_from_Glade_Proto()
  - PerlSource->write_Subclass() will generate a working subclass with 
    skeleton subs for all missing signal handlers
  - PerlSource->write_dist() started new sub to generate dist files
  - PerlProject->use_Glade_Project() now defaults to allow_gnome if programmer
    has set <project><gnome_support> to True
  - PerlSource->perl_SUBCLASS_AUTOLOAD_header() new sub and some extra 
    utilities generated (toplevel_hide, toplevel_close and toplevel_destroy)
  - Gnome::Druid* stuff implemented (needs Gtk-Perl CVS after 19991025 and
    gnome-libs >= 1.0.50 to get the full effect)
  - PerlRun->create_image() new sub to return a Gtk::Gdk::ImlibImage for
    Gnome::Druid* logos and watermarks
        
Fri Oct 22 19:42:41 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
 - Version 0.40
 - New version number format to meet demands of CPAN
 - Stable(ish) version split off from 0.3.15 for upload to CPAN
    
Sun Oct 10 03:42:41 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.15
    - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkCTree() fixed cut-and-paste error to initialise the
      column count for CTree (rather than CList) Problem showed up with more 
      than one CTree per project.
    - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkC[Tree|List]() fixed to set column widths
    - PerlSource AUTOLOAD type source code generation split off so that I can
      start to develop a user selected code style eg closures and Exporter
      
Sun Oct 10 03:42:41 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.14
    - PerlUI->set_widget_properties() 'has_focus' now set correctly
    - PerlUI lots of commented out redundant code removed.
    - PerlUI->set_container_properties() does border_width even for '0' now
    - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to use Gnome::App->set_contents for
      all widgets except Gnome::DockItem.
    - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to add() CList/CTree widgets rather
      than add_with_viewport() that is used for all others because these widgets 
      handle their own scrolling in order to keep the column labels visible
    - PerlSource->perl_new_header() new AUTOLOAD method INSTANCE() to get/set 
      the form instance key into $all_forms.
    - PerlSource->perl_UI_new_bottom() changed to store a ref to the FORM 
      structure in the global hash $all_forms. This allows you to get at the 
      widgets properly. Also the key into glabal $all_forms is now set using the 
      AUTOLOAD method INSTANCE() so that you can get at the form instance.
      
Tue Oct  5 00:31:41 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.13
    - PerlUI was getting too big so I have split off a new module PerlUIGtk 
      to construct the Gtk widgets leaving all the utilities in PerlUI
    - PerlUI(Gtk) implemented some bugfixes in CVS 19990922 including
      PerlUIGtk->new_GtkNotebook() fixed to use $parent->notebook() if needed
      PerlUI->new_from_child_name() fixed to add vbox to GnomeApps. This lets
      you add some widgets to an App now <sheepish-grin>
    - PerlUI(Gtk) implemented some bugfixes in CVS 19991001 including
      PerlUIExtra->new_GnomeIconList() constructs with undef adjustment
      PerlUI->new_from_child_name() now uses Gnome::Stock->pixmap_widget()
      PerlUIGtk->new_GtkColorSelectionDialog now lets you set the button labels
    - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() now does nothing for action_area as this
      accessor doesn't return anything until something is added.
    - PerlUIGtk->new_GtkMenuItem() amended to improve underline accelerators
    - PerlUI->use_par() altered to dynamically lookup Gnome enums in .h files.
      and cache them during the build run.
      
Fri Sep 25 23:52:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.12
    - PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() and ->set_child_packing() fixed to cope 
      with Gtk::Packer and its children properly
    - Version dependency checking added for Gtk-Perl and gnome-libs
    - Documentation/NEWS split off from README
    - Gnome::App            implemented 
      Gtk-Perl is still missing the GNOMEUIINFO bindings so Gnome::App menus
      and toolbar icons are as incompletely constructed as normal ones ie.
      accelerators and underlines are not handled properly <sigh>
    - Gnome::AppBar         implemented
    - Gnome::Dock           implemented
    - Gnome::DockItem       implemented
    - Gnome::IconList       implemented
    - Gnome::IconSelection  implemented
    - Gnome::PropertyBox    implemented
    - Gnome::Spell          implemented
    - Gtk::Calendar         implemented in PerlUI (rather than PerlUIExtra)
    - PerlXML->QuoteXMLChars() is improved and the missing &XmlUtf8Encode() 
      written.
    - Some tidying of modules' BEGIN blocks
    - Gtk::Notebook now initialises the notebook page list on creation. This 
      allows for more than one notebook per project.
    - PerlUI->new_from_child_name() new sub to get a ref to existing widget of
      composite widgets (for instance vbox or ok_button or action_area) and 
      this functionality removed from elsewhere - too many places :-)
    - Changes to cater for Glade 0.5.3
    
Thu Aug 26 17:30:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.11
    - PerlUI - new_GtkDialog split off from GtkWindow and correct methods used
      to attach widgets ie vbox(), action_area(). Doesn't work yet as Gtk-Perl
      doesn't derive Window methods like allow_grow(). I am holding my breath.
    - Fixed style colors (converted 8bpp-16bpp) and bg_pixmaps (child->style).
    - Added project description to user options (for about_Form or whatever)
    - PerlRun->create_pixmap now prints errors on STDERR
    - PerlUI->new_Gtk[HV]ButtonBox() fixed set_child_size to use width, height
    - PerlUI->new_signal() missing handler diag message is now a warning
    - PerlUI->new_signal() now stored the signal_connect() calls so that they
      can be eval()ed when all the widgets are constructed. This allows for
      the perl equivalent of signal_connect_abject(_after) to be sure of
      finding a valid widget to connect to. 
      It also means that all radio_buttons are constructed and possibly set 
      active before the signals are connected. This way they don't trigger each 
      other's handlers as they are constructed and set active.
    - PerlUI->widget_from_Proto() changed to eval() the signal_connect()s after
      all the widgets are constructed (see above).
    - PerlSource->Perl_UI_new_bottom() now generates source code for a 
      Gnome::About box if Gnome is enabled (rather than PerlRun version).
      
Sat Aug 21 19:54:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.10
    - PerlUI->new_signal() implemented properties <data> and <object>
    - PerlUI->new_GtkAccelLabel() underline accelerator support started
    - Gnome stock_menu and stock_button sort of implemented
    - PerlSource - Fixed the warnings on Gtk->main_quit by passing a string
      which is the key to a new global $all_forms that holds refs to all form
      instances rather than passing the ref itself.
    - PerlUIExtra - Gnome::App, AppBar, Dock, DockItem started but incomplete
    - PerlUI->new_signal() now only connects live handlers if UI is being shown
    - PerlSource - All modules now store a ref to the form in global hash 
      $Glade::PerlRun::all_forms
    - PerlRun - new global hash $all_forms, see above
    
Sat Aug 21 02:24:31 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.9
    - Stopped silly style crashes when default style specified to 0.3.8
    - Removed debug messages from new_style()
    
Mon Aug 16 16:28:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.8
    - Changes to reflect improvements in gnome-perl CVS 17 Aug 1999)
      Gnome::PixmapEntry, Gnome::Entry->max_saved() implemented
      Gnome::FileEntry->set_modal() and set_directory() implemented
      Gtk::Menubar->set_shadow_type() implemented
    - Optionmenu item naming now generic
    - permitted_stubs (AUTOLOAD subs) now defined only in the class that needs
      them (rather than all names in all classes)
    - PerlUI - signals now pass a class object instance (of form) to handler
      although there are perl warnings on exit (perl -w)
    - PerlUI - Implementation of styles begun, font works, colors don't :-(
    
Fri Aug 13 04:10:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.7
    - $VERSION, $AUTHOR and $DATE now exported from PerlRun to all packages
    - Distribution directory structure changed to hold all documentation in a
      'Documentation' directory and supplied examples in directory 'Example'
      (used to be directory 'Existing')
      
Tue Jul 27 04:08:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.6
    - FAQ started
    - All modules' BEGIN subs are on a reducing diet
    - More Gnome widgets added
    - Glade 0.5.1 new widget properties handled
    
Fri Jul 23 22:04:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.5
    - Automatically generated signal connects for toplevels removed. They
      must be specified as signals in the Glade file.
    - Gnome widgets' implementation started. There is not a very good match
      between Glade and Gtk-Perl so all I can implement is the overlap.
    - new user option 'allow_gnome' to produce code for the Gnome widgets 
      that have been implemented
      
Fri Jul 16 18:07:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.4
    - PerlProject fixed so that start_date is updated from Glade (verbose => 0)
    - PerlSource altered so that dynamic stubs will be defined for all signal
      handlers so that they will still AUTOLOAD if existing handlers are lost
    - New file Existing/BusForm_Subclass.pm as example of how to subclass a
      generated UI class.
    - PerlUI - Error label generated for empty notebook pages.
    - PerlGenerate and PerlSource amended to generate separate classes for
      each toplevel window/dialog that can be subclassed.
      UI constructor is now called new().
    
Fri Jul 16 01:11:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.3
    - moved globals to method 'new_Window' to allow multiple instances of
      a form to be visible.
    - All widgets are now returned by new_Window and are available using the 
      class method eg $class->FORMS->{$formname}{$widgetname}->show;
    
Thu Jul 15 22:38:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.2
    - SUBS module combined into UI class. This didn't take as long as I 
      thought it might!
    
Thu Jul 08 18:04:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.1
    - PerlUI - corrected new_GtkText constructor.
    - Whole approach altered to implement an object oriented approach
    - PerlSource amended to produce new style perl code   as per perltoot
    - Signal handler stubs are now dynamically AUTOLOADED as per perltoot
    - Hierarchy inverted so that OO class constructed in SUBS

Mon Jul 05 00:12:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.3.0
    - Development branch split off
    - PerlSource - removed redundant globals
    - destroy_Form not exported from PerlRun but now included in generated 
      UI source files.
        
Mon Jul 05 00:12:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.2.0
    - First 'stable' release

Wed Jun 30 17:39:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.15
    - Glade::PerlSource - Generated SUBS module exports METHODS specifically
                          Generated UI module imports SUBS METHODS specifically 
    - Existing modules are now expected to EXPORT_TAGS 'VARS' and 'METHODS' 
      which should contain anonymous arrays of variables and methods. Check a
      generated SUBS module or Existing/BusForm_mySUBS.pm for one way to do this.
    - Fixed verbosity 0 handling (this speeds up build from Glade a lot!)
    - Fixed build from string
    - altered and fixed test script
    
Sat Jun 26 00:33:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.14
    - option file names changed to Damon Chaplin's suggestion of
        site_options     /etc/glade2perl.xml
        user_options     $ENV{'HOME'}/.glade2perl.xml
        project_options  Project.glade2perl.xml for Glade file 'Project.glade'
    - Changed string handling in add_to_UI etc to store the perl source in
      an array and join() it rather than dot concatenation which copies the
      strings at each concatenation. Reference run improved significantly!
      Very rough timings on my K6 166 Linux 2.2.1 give an improvement from
      20 seconds to 15 seconds.
    - Glade::PerlGenerate split into several modules
      Glade::PerlGenerate   still the main user interface
      Glade::PerlXML        to load/save XML
      Glade::PerlProject    to handle project options
      Glade::PerlUI         to construct the UI
      Glade::PerlSource     to write the source code
    - Removed most of the namespace pollution from all modules
    - Tidied globals and exporting of vars and methods (including Glade::PerlRun)
    
Thu Jun 24 18:13:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.13
    - Options are now loaded/saved from/to gpgrc.xml files (XML) if
      possible so that generation from Glade can use existing modules etc
      and it is possible to have site, user and project-specific defaults.
    - New sub XML_from_Proto to convert a Proto back to prettily formatted
      XML to save options in disk file.
    - New sub merge_options to read options from disk and merge with options
      already read options - see below.
    - Options are merged from Glade::PerlGenerate defaults, then site_options
      (default /etc/gpgrc.xml) then user_options (default ~/.gpgrc.xml) 
      then project_options (default Glade filename with ext .gpgrc.xml instead 
      of .glade or .xml) and finally from the options supplied as args to
      Glade::PerlGenerate->options. The merged options are saved as a new
      project_options file if a file name was specified. It should work in the 
      same way as 0.0.12 if nothing extra is specified and none of the
      options files exist. At the moment, the gpgrc.xml files must be 
      hand-edited although Glade::PerlGenerate->options will override the
      project_options from the file for that and later Build runs.
    
Tue Jun 22 21:03:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.12
    - Fixed Table layout, Gtk-Perl wanted [] anon array of strings !
    - Fixed Form_from_XML uninitilized warnings
    - Limited automatic MenuItem accelerators (prefixed with '_' underscore)
      to provide mod1 + next letter.
      (eg Alt+f for Menu under the Menubar MenuItem with label '_File')
    - Default signal handlers connected for each window destroy/delete_event
    
Tue Jun 16 14:54:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.11
    - All references to curly brackets in user method calls removed
      from the docs to reflect the changes to options and 
      Form_from_Glade_File and Form_from_XML arg layout 
      The arg is now a hash rather than an anonymous hash.
    - Common property-setting moved to new subs. This means
      that widgets that are not always stored in the XML file should
      be handled. Much simpler and easier to maintain.
    - Radio button/menuitem grouped properly now.
    - Testfile renamed to BusForm.glade in line with Damon's naming
    - Changes have begun for Glade 0.5.0 - 
    - Label should have 'wrap' property but Gtk-Perl can't do this
    - Progressbar has many new properties
    - Toolbar should have 'space_style' propewty - Gtk-Perl can't do this
    - Glade script now called 'rename-to-glade2perl' for obvious reasons
    
Tue Jun 16 07:00:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.10 embarassment release
    - Fixed masquerade script (removed curly-brackets)
      
Mon Jun 15 00:15:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>

    - Partial fix for pixmaps
    - More code tidying
    
Sun Jun 13 21:30:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.8
    - Some code tidying
    - Changes to use_Glade_Project to handle dirnames in the same way as Glade
    - Changes to allow more efficient background running (eg from Glade)
    - Now included an example script for Glade to call
        
Thu Jun 10 14:40:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.7
    - Modules renamed to Glade::PerlGenerate and Glade::PerlRun. It
      was suggested that I use these slightly more descriptive names
      but what really clinched it was my lack of understanding of 
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker and the unnecessary complications of several
      depths of directory and module. Nevertheless, see below
    - There is now a Makefile.PL !!!!! (based on one from Robert Schwebel)
    - Some other tidying up (especially Glade::PerlGenerator->use_par
      which now understands function keys and chars as well as actually
      making a bit more sense, logically.
    - Keyboard accelerators now (almost) work.
    - Improved diagnostic message handling.

Thu Jun 10 14:40:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.6
    - Now will not write empty SUBS file
    - Generated 'about_Form' sub moved to UI module to allow the change above
    - Some more widget properties implemented
    
Wed Jun  9 06:00:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.5
    - I have tried to tidy the Perl layout and shorten the lines
    - The diagnostic messages should also be more legible on smaller displays
    - Source code indent is now user option (default 4 spaces)
    - Unused widget properties now reported as the widget is constructed
    
Sun Jun  5 17:30:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.4
    - new sub Generate->options to simplify run control
    - Some refinements
		
Sat Jun  5 23:30:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.3
    - Most widgets implemented
    - Some (this) documentation included
    - Some debugging code removed
	
Sat Jun  5 19:25:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.2
    - Each toplevel widget now has a its own flat hash containing packed widgets
    - More error checking and reporting
    - Module and file names are now generated to force some consistency.
	
Fri Jun  4 00:18:00 BST 1999 - Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove@virgin.net>
    - Version 0.0.1 split off from a larger and somewhat open-ended
      project. It now includes Glade::Perl::Generate (GPG) that can read a 
      Glade XML file, convert it into	a hierarchy of widgets in a hash, build 
      the UI using Gtk-Perl and write the	sources to two Perl .pm files.
      Glade::Perl::Run has some run-time subs used in the Generate run and 
      also in any subsequent runs of the generated Perl modules.
