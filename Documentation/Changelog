- Version 0.61
- PerlRun->fix_name() a new sub to substitute illegal chars in perl names
  will also deal with + - / * ! . ' ' chars in project/class/handler names
- PerlUI->new_signal() changed to use fix_name()
- PerlUI->construct_widget() also now fixes toplevel widget names so that
  package names are more likely to be valid.
- PerlUI->construct_widget() now dies if you define two forms with the same 
  name in one project.
- PerlProject new user option <gnome_incs> to point to Gnome include files.
- README/Gtk-Perl-Docs.html new gtk-perl mailing list and email addresses.

- PerlSource->dist_test_pl() spurious curly bracket removed from output.
- PerlRun->load_pixmap() will now take pixmap data as string.
- PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to add() Gnome::Canvas instead
  of add_with_viewport() - thanks to Rolf Herzog
- PerlUI->new_signal() fixed to escape any double-quotes in data.
- PerlUI->set_window_properties() generates 'set_position()' now.
  
Fri May  3 03:56:25 BST 2002 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.60
- Documentation and dist files written for Libglade style apps as well.
- PerlRun->save_file_from_string() allows writing undef string.
- PerlUI->new_GtkSpinButton() bug fix for set_wrap() code.
- PerlProject->use_Glade_Project() forces a leading '#' for 'copying'.
- PerlSource->perl_preamble() (extra) leading '#' removed from 'copying.
- PerlSource->dist_Makefile_PL() now uses Glade-Perl's min. requirements
  as defaults for Makefile.PL version checks for Gtk and Gnome.
- PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to add() Gnome::IconLists instead
  of add_with_viewport() - thanks to René Seindal <rene at seindal.dk>
- PerlUI->new_accelerator() changed to generate code that looks up the
  keyval at UI construction time so that apps are more portable.
  Also generated code will use Gtk::Gdk->keyval_from_name() in case any
  subsequent app user doesn't have a populated Gtk::Keysyms.pm (some RPMs)
- PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() similarly changed.
- PerlUIExtra->new_GnomeEntry() fixed to set history ID correctly.
  Thanks to Franco Broi for the bug report.
- PerlSource->perl_AUTOLOAD_top() small change to generated sub AUTOLOAD()
- PerlSource->perl_*_top() now generate modules with initial version
  number of 0.10 (was 0.01) to make scripts handling the distribution of
  modules more predictable - minor version now always has 2 significant
  digits and can be incremented without packing (eg. 0.10 > 0.11).
  Also %params now passed through from toplevel script to app_run()
- New user option <source><save_connect_id>1</save_connect_id></source>
  and PerlUI->new_signal() changed to generate code that will save all 
  the signal connection ids in a predictable way so that signals can be
  blocked and unblocked in handlers. The connection id is held in eg:
    my $id = $forms->{'__CONNECT_ID'}{'entry1'}{'after_key_press_event'}
  and can be used like $form->{'entry1'}->signal_handler_block($id);
  and later $form->{'entry1'}->signal_handler_unblock($id);
  or $form->{'entry1'}->signal_disconnect($id);
  or $form->{'entry1'}->signal_emit($id);
  The last hash key is either 'signal' or 'after_signal' depending on
  whether the signal is connected normally or after. I have never needed
  this functionality but someone asked for it, the costs of the changes
  are negligible and they should not affect any existing code - just 
  don't give any widget the name '__CONNECT_ID'. 
  The default (0) produces the same code as previous versions.
- PerlProject->use_Glade_project() fixed to write missing project logo.
- PerlSource->dist_MANIFEST_SKIP() generates file MANIFEST.SKIP such that
  src/ProjectSIGS.pm will not be included in default MANIFEST file when 
  you run 'make manifest'
- PerlRun->write_missing_gettext_strings() produces better .pot file
- FAQ - new Q/A about automatic installion using CPAN.pm and updated Q/A 
  about accessing widgets with PerlRun->lookup_widget() new in 0.59
- PerlUI->use_par() fixed to escape leading single quote in string
- PerlUI->Widget_from_Proto() split into construct_widget() and 
  new_sub_widget(). This is an attempt to tidy the code a little.
- PerlRun data fields altered to double quote default 'copying' message
  so that the \n is interpolated. Thanks to Mark W. Eichin for report.
- PerlProject->use_Glade_project() fixed to not escape author strings
  and PerlSource->perl_preamble() to cope with the change. Also Mark :)
- PerlSource->perl_about() fixed to pass author/description/copying
  as single-quoted literals in generated code (see above).
- $PACKAGE, $VERSION, $AUTHOR, $DATE fields not now inherited from
  Glade::PerlRun. This was bad behaviour and broke the CPAN automatic
  updating module so each module is separately updated now.

Wed Jun 20 14:48:25 BST 2001 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.59
- All modules now have empty DESTROY() sub as perl 5.6 demands.
  PerlRun->AUTOLOAD() also caters for (ignores) AUTOLOADED DESTROY() call.
  PerlRun perldoc corrected to lose warnings in pod2man.
  Thanks to Jim Edwards for the super-fast reports and patches.
- PerlRun->lookup_widget() is a new method that accesses a window or a
  form's widget by name. It prints an error if the widget does not exist.
  e.g. my $widget = $window->lookup_widget('clist1');
    OR my $form = $window->FORM; # or use $form in signal handlers
       my $widget = $form->lookup_widget('clist1');
- Glade-Perl will now create skeleton documentation files if they
  do not already exist. These default to directory 'Documentation' files
  called COPYING, Changelog, FAQ, INSTALL, NEWS, README, ROADMAP and TODO
  If you don't want to generate the doc files add a line to site or 
  project options file:
    <doc><write>0</write></doc>
- Glade-Perl will now create skeleton distribution files if they
  do not already exist. These default to - Makefile.PL, MANIFEST.SKIP, 
  Project.spec and test.pl - so you should be able to call:
  'perl Makefile.PL; make manifest; make dist;' and then either
  'rpm -ta Project-0.01.tar.gz' to build a RPM or the normal perl methods
  of 'make test' and 'make install'. This is all at a very early stage 
  and will probably fail in many cases but you should, at least, have 
  some files to edit :)
  If you don't want to generate the dist files add a line to site or 
  project options file:
    <dist><write>0</write></dist>
  
Fri Apr 13 01:01:22 BST 2001 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.58
- Mimimum requirements increased to Gtk-Perl-0.7000 and gnome-libs-1.2.0
  These have been around for a year or more now and fix many problems.
- All packages - Extensive tidying of options handling with a new data
  structure. Old format options files will be read as before but project 
  options will be saved in the new hierarchically nested structure.
- The options handling and diagnostics utilities have been moved to
  Glade::PerlRun so that you can use them in your own apps.
- PerlUI - some variables updated for Gtk-Perl-0.7004 and later.
- Some changes to generated comments and source code.
- glade2perl - removed redundant 'use English' call
  New, more meaningful 'set_by' value and 
  New (2nd) arg to specify verbosity in glade2perl call 
  eg. 'glade2perl Project.glade 2'
  Simplified usage so that a separate Glade::PerlGenerate->options() call
  is not needed and the options can be specified to Form_from_File()
  Also, undefined glade_filename causes most recently used file stored
  in your user options file to run.
- PerlRun->reload_any_altered_modules() is a new sub for app testing to 
  reload any modules that have been edited. This idea is from Stas Bekman
  and gives you the ability to edit and reload any signal handlers and 
  support modules without closing down the app and restarting it. 
  This is not possible if you regenerate the UI module and reload it.
  Your app will crash in flames if you try this.
  Simply call '__PACKAGE__->reload_any_altered_modules;' in a handler 
  for any widget/signal you like (I usually use a Refresh button).
- PerlGenerate->Form_from_Glade_File() amended to call two new subs
  parse_form() and build_form() to allow use in future Glade::Helper app.
- PerlGenerate->about_Form() fixed to use proper pixmap option
- PerlGenerate->Form_from_Proto() now only generates subclass for simple
  AUTOLOAD style runs.
- PerlRun->load_translations() amended to look for .mo files in several
  possible places if a catalog path is not specified.
- An extra form element is now returned from generated UI constructor so
  that you can call $form->{'TOPLEVEL'} in any signal handler to get a
  toplevel form widget - ie. use $form->{'TOPLEVEL'}->get_filename() to
  get the file name entered in a fileselection dialog from the
  'on_ok_button_clicked' signal handler.
- PerlUI->my_gtk_perl_can_do() now also checks for particular versions
  that are known to be flawed in certain ways.
- FAQ split into 3 files - all old FAQs are available on the website.
    FAQ       - Frequently asked questions (general)
    FAQ.i18n  - FAQs relating to internationalisation (I18N) issues.
    FAQ.old   - FAQs relating to old/flawed software versions
- PerlSource->perl_about() generates `gnome-config --version` call in
  Gnome about_Form() sub in App/SubApp. If the gnome-libs-devel RPM 
  is not installed the gnome-libs version number will not be reported.
- PerlSource now generates lines in app_run to load translations.
- Glade-Perl.spec file based on one from George, the mp3 organiser. 
  This one works I think and allows RPM builds from the tarball by 
  calling eg. 'rpm -ta Glade-Perl-0.58.tar.gz'.
- PerlUI->new_accelerator() - accelerator key now defaults to ''.
  PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() also defaults key to ''
  PerlProject->use_Glade_Project() now escapes double quotes in author.
  Thanks for bug reports for the above reports to Joe "Markus" Clark.
  
Fri Oct 20 01:19:45 BST 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.57
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkPixmap() fixed to use project logo as default rather
  than crash in flames if no pixmap is specified.
- PerlUIExtra->new_GnomePixmap() now also uses project logo as default
- PerlUI->Widget_from_Proto() fixed to report missing constructors 
  and properties correctly rather than die()ing.
- $PerlUI::perl_gtk_depends updated to ignore gnome-db widgets until
  Gtk::Perl can handle them.
- PerlRun->full_Path() fixed to remove any /../ parts in the filename
  so that the returned full path is exact and unique if possible.
- PerlGenerate pod corrected and improved.
- COPYING file changed to invite commercial users to make a donation to 
  perl.org (donors at perlmongers.org) rather than me ;-> I borrowed the 
  COPYING file from a CPAN module and was embarrassed to reread it when
  Scott Barninger of Piedmont Airlines accepted the invitation!
- PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to pack Gtk::PixmapMenuItem
  submenus correctly.
- Glade-Perl.spec file borrowed from Gtk-Perl dist to allow RPM builds.
  This doesn't work yet - but if you can help ...
- PerlSource amended to also write a method app_run() to ProjectSIGS.pm
  and Project.pm (first time) for any user UI initialisation code.
- PerlGUIGtk->new_GtkButton() now caters for 'relief' (in Glade-0.5.10)
- PerlGUIGtk->new_GtkToggleButton() now caters for 'relief' (as above)
- Null source_directory now generates source in project directory (and
  not in ./src) to match the actions of Glade 0.5.11.
- New error message if there are minus signs/spaces/dots in signal handler 
  names - they are substituted by _MINUS_/_SPACE_/_DOT_. This is really 
  to deal with the new (Glade 0.5.10) default widget names for combo_box
  entry widgets (eg combo-entry1 and handler on_combo-entry1_activate)
- Changelog - this file reduced to versions >= 0.50. (Older on website)
- If the user option <style> includes 'split' the app and signal handler
  modules will be generated with each class in its own file. See the
  test example to see how this works.
- test.pl extended to test both the split base classes and the subclass.

Wed Apr 19 02:28:58 BST 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.56 - embarassment release
- Makefile.PL unchanged so that it will install all the modules correctly.
  
Wed Apr 19 02:28:58 BST 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.55
- New FAQ about building Unicode::String for perl 5.6
- PerlXML->Proto_from_XML_Parser_Tree() changed to cancel the use of 
  encodings if Unicode::String is not available. You should not need to
  install Unicode::String now unless you use european characters.
- Documentation/Gtk-Perl-Docs.html tidied and Stephen Wilhelm's Gtk-Perl
  tutorial http://personal.riverusers.com/~swilhelm/perlgtk/tutorial/
  now pushed as the best starting point for learning Gtk-Perl.
  
Sun Apr 16 00:07:26 BST 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.54
- PerlUI->new_from_child_name() fixed to use gnome_app_docked_item() and
  not construct our own widgets and containers (Damon's ideas)
  Also now better handles notebooks as children of Gnome Dialogs
- PerlGenerate->unused_elements() name now check_for_unused_elements()
- PerlUI->new_signal() changed 'Missing signal handler' message to 
  verbose level 4 so that verbose => 2 gives more compact diagnostics. 
  Skeleton signal handlers are still generated in ProjectSIGS.pm for you 
  to copy somewhere and edit as before.
- Makefile.PL fixed to use the correct module name (Glade-Perl)
- PerlSource->write_LIBGLADE() fixed to produce working signal handlers.
- PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() changed to use the new bindings in
  Gtk-Perl (CVS 20000410) that actually construct a PixmapMenuItem 
  instead of just a Gtk::MenuItem. Earlier versions of Gtk-Perl will now
  construct Gtk::MenuItem explicitly.
- Documentation - all email addresses in online documentation are now 
  mangled to reduce spam for those kind enough to send bug reports/patches.
  
Tue Apr 11 15:45:29 BST 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.53
- New FAQ about character encodings.
- PerlProject two new user options to handle character encodings.
  <glade_encoding> to specify the Glade file character encoding.
  <glade2perl_encoding> to specify the glade2perl.xml project options 
  file character encoding (defaults to glade_encoding).
- PerlXML->QuoteXMLChars() characters x80-xff not now encoded so project
  options are saved without re-encoding eg european characters.
- PerlXML->save_options() extra declaration line with character encoding
  eg <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> written to head of file.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkAccelLabel() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkLabel() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkCheckButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkToggleButton() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkCheckMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkRadioMenuItem() underlines now parsed correctly.
- PerlUIExtra->new_GtkPixmapMenuItem() much simplified and underlines 
  now parsed correctly.
- Perl* all packages now have an empty DESTROY method to keep perl 5.006
  happy when it is running cleanup with warnings enabled.
- PerlSource->perl_AUTOLOAD_top, perl_SUBCLASS_top, perl_LIBGLADE_top
  amended to write empty DESTROY() subs to generated classes (see above)
- PerlGenerate documentation - perldoc (and manpage) corrected and 
  improved to include all user options.

Fri Mar 31 16:44:38 BST 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.52
- PerlSource->check_gettext_strings() and write_gettext_strings() are
  two new subs to help you spot missing translations and write a .pot file
- PerlRun->D_(), S_() moved to to PerlSource to remove run-time pollution.
- PerlSource->_() overrides PerlRun->_()  for gettext string checking.
- PerlSource added some commented lines to the generated sources to do the 
  gettext string checking for the user.
- PerlSource->perl_LIBGLADE_top() added a file check and better 
  explanation if the Glade file is missing in the generated run() sub.
- ppo/Glade-Perl.pot I have found some more strings to be translated :(
- PerlSource all subs now have '} # End of sub %name' as last line
- PerlUI->set_widget_properites() finally implemented set_events() and
  set_extension_events() generation.
- PerlGenerate->Form_from_Glade_file() and Form_from_XML() amended to 
  create proto to allow multiple accelerators for a widget.
- Perl* all subs that use Glade-Perl user options improved. The defaults 
  are now more correctly determined and fewer options should be saved in 
  the project_options file 
- PerlGenerate->Form_from_XML() fixed to do what it should again.
- PerlUIGtk->new_GtkVPaned() fixed to supply a default position. This 
  seems to be caused because Glade-0.5.7 doesn't save all default values.
  Most other defaults also now supplied in case of further changes.
  Thanks to Ned Konz <ned at bike-nomad.com> for the report
- Popup menus with keyboard accelerators and tooltips generated correctly
  Thanks to Skywolf Lu <skywolf at ms21.hinet.net> for the report
- PerlGenerate->unused_widgets() now only warns (verbose >= 4) when C++
  specific widget properties are encountered (they are currently ignored).
  Thanks to Robert Schwebel <robert at schwebel.de> for the report.
  
Thu Mar  2 04:30:08 GMT 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.51
- PerlUI testing source comments removed from generated code
- PerlRun->create_image() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
- PerlUIExtra->new_GnomeAbout() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
- PerlUIExtra->new_GnomePixmap() pixmaps made relative to usual global.
  so now there should be no hard-coded paths in the generated code :)
- PerlUI->internal_pack_widget() fixed to add() Gtk::Text objects to a
  Gtk::ScrolledWindow correctly (like Gtk::CTree or Gtk::CList).
  Thanks to Frank de Lange for an excellent report and suggestions.
- PerlUI->new_from_child_name() amended to deal with Gnome::Dialogs
- PerlUIExtra->frig_Gnome_Dialog_buttons() to add Gnome::Dialog buttons
  and accelerators in a better way (unstandard in Glade-Perl though :( )
  This works for all Gnome Dialogs (MessageBox, PropertyBox, Dialog)
  but only with gnome-perl CVS after 20000301.
- PerlRun->load_translations() and mo_format_value() _(), S_() and D_() 
  new subs to implement gettext support for apps, source and diagnostics. 
- PerlUI* generate gettext code for all text fields in widgets.
- PerlSource->perl_AUTOLOAD_top() now generates load_translation() call 
- All modules diagnostics messages converted to sprintf-like format so
  that diag_print can translate them.
- PerlProject->diag_print() became diag_ref_print() and new diag_print()
  written for i18n of Glade-Perl. You can now specify the language for
  diagnostics, the language for the source (comments) and the generated 
  apps can use their own languages! 
  All defaults are $ENV{'LANG'} but diagnostics and source languages can 
  be overridden in the site, user or Project.glade2perl.xml options files
  
Thu Feb 24 22:57:47 GMT 2000 Dermot Musgrove <dermot.musgrove at virgin.net>
- Version 0.50 embarassment release
- PerlUiExtra->new_GtkPixMeneuItem() fixes to string quoting
