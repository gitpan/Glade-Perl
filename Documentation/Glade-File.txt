GLADE PROJECT
-------------
Glade::PerlGenerate uses the Glade <project> details in order to 
generate the code and uses certain information. These are the <project> 
elements that it uses from the GTK-Interface XML file:

<project>
# The Glade project structure

  <name>BusForm</name>
#   Project name (it is used for the file and package/module/class name)

  <directory></directory>
#   Directory that Glade was running in when project was written ??
 
  <source_directory>Generated</source_directory>
#   Directory to hold generated source modules (relative to XML file)
		
  <pixmaps_directory>pixmaps</pixmaps_directory>
#   Directory to search for pixmaps (relative to XML file)
#   If there is a pixmap in this directory called 'Logo.xpm' this
#   will be used as the project logo in message boxes etc.
		
  <gnome_support>True</gnome_support>
# From version 0.41 this property is now respected.

# All other project properties are ignored

</project>

Some other project information is generated for inclusion in the generated
source modules.
