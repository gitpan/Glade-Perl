ROADMAP Where is Glade::PerlGenerate going?

From version 22 October 1999 I am using Perl type release numbers - ie 0.40
        
0.50  New options structure (and file) ?? I am going off the idea :)

0.55  Fix keyboard accelerators and underlines
0.56  Glade::PerlDist files and methods to build Makefile.PL etc and doc stubs
0.57  Glade::PerlHelper GUI options editor and generation control
0.58  Implement any new Glade widgets (eg GnomeDb)
0.59  Make documentation complete (inc perldoc)

0.60  Stable release

0.70  Use libxml?
0.71  Some communication with Glade and editor (possibly include a builtin)
0.75  Use XML streams or SAX parser ??

0.80   Stable release

This is only a rough plan so if you have any good ideas or urgent 
requirements please tell me.
