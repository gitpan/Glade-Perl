ROADMAP Where is Glade::PerlGenerate going?

From version 22 October 1999 I am using Perl type release numbers - ie 0.40
        
0.50  New options structure (and file) ?? I am going off the idea :)

0.62  Glade::PerlDist files and methods to build Makefile.PL etc and doc stubs
0.64  Glade::PerlHelper GUI options editor and generation control
0.66  Implement any new Glade widgets (eg GnomeDb)

0.70  Use libxml?
0.71  Some communication with Glade and editor (possibly include a builtin)
0.75  Use XML streams or SAX parser ??

This is only a rough plan so if you have any good ideas or urgent 
requirements please tell me.
