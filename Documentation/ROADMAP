ROADMAP Where is Glade::PerlGenerate going?

From version 22 October 1999 I am using Perl type release numbers - ie 0.40
        
0.40   Stable version will be split off from 0.3.14 if it works well

0.51   More Gnome stuff that appears in Perl/Gtk CVS versions
0.51   New options structure (and file) ??

0.52   Glade::PerlDist files and methods to build Makefile.PL etc and doc stubs
0.53   Glade::PerlHelper GUI options editor and generation control
0.54   More complete installation mechanism
            install glade2perl and any other scripts
            check for required packages
0.56   Implement any remaining Gnome and other widgets (eg GtkXmHTM)
0.57   Make documentation complete (inc perldoc)

0.60   Stable release

0.70   Use libglade and libxml ?
0.71   Some communication with Glade and editor (possibly include a builtin)
0.75   Use XML streams or SAX parser

0.80   Stable release

This is only a rough plan so if you have any good ideas or urgent 
requirements please tell me.
