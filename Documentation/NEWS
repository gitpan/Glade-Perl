NEWS of Glade::PerlGenerate (GPG) Gtk-Perl-Glade UI builder and source generator
--------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW 'FEATURES'
--------------
version 0.59 Produces documentation and distribution files

version 0.58 changes for Gtk-Perl-0.7005 and much tidying.

version 0.57 updated to cater for Glade 0.5.11 changes

version 0.53 parses underline accelerators and handles character encodings
    in Glade and glade2perl files better

version 0.52 has some utilities to help you to produce the gettext strings
    that need to be translated, just by running the generated subclass.
    More defaults added so that Glade-0.5.7 files will not fail.
    
version 0.51 generates i18n-capable code - except underline accelerators :(
    It is also i18n capable itself. See the diagnostics in one language, the
    source code in another and the generated apps will run in any language
    that you make .mo files for (all from one build run)
    
version 0.50 pixmaps are now handled with relative paths. Glade-Perl now
    can also generate hierarchical widget structures so that you can access 
    widgets like :
    $form->{'vbox1'}{'frame2'}{'hbox3'}{entry1'}{'__W'}->get_text;
    
version 0.48 has a better make install. It fixes some bugs but the main changes
    are to the generated code structure. Old apps that use the generated files
    will work in the same way but the simpler structure means that you can
    edit the file Project.pm in situ and it will not be overwritten.
    UI code also connects signal handlers more correctly so that it should
    work however you call it - even from a perl script (eg package main)
    
version 0.45 Has fixes for Gtk-Perl-0.7000 and recent CVS (29 Dec 1999)

version 0.44 Can generate a module that uses libglade to show the UI

version 0.42 implements Gnome::Animator and makes change necessary for
    Gtk-Perl CVS versions after 19991029. Also fixes some Gnome related 
    failures (I hope). 
    You will need the CVS version after 19991107 and Glade 0.5.4 to see all
    the improvements although older versions should still work.

version 0.41 implements Gnome::Druid stuff and also generates a working
    subclass with skeleton signal handler subs for you to copy and edit.
    We can now generate _all_ Glade widgets (and mostly correctly :-)
    
version 0.40 is the first CPAN release - hence the new version number format

version 0.3.14 is mainly a bugfix release with more useful values returned
    in the generated form constructors and some widgets packed properly now.
    
version 0.3.13 allows you to have a Gnome::App with some widgets in it! Some
    bug fixes from CVS versions of 19990922 and 19991001 are implemented and
    Gtk widget constructors split off from Glade::PerlUI into new module
    Glade::PerlUIGtk. Gnome enums looked up at run-time.

version 0.3.12 does most Gnome stuff now but you will need the CVS version
    after 19990922 to get the best from it. I have added a version dependancy
    checking so that older versions (eg Gtk-Perl 0.6123) will still work but 
    without the improvements and newer CVS builds can get at the improvements.
    
version 0.3.11 handles all widgets/properties that Gtk-Perl 0.6123 can handle
    as well as styles, although Glade cannot handle styles properly yet.
    Signals are now connected after the widgets are constructed.

version 0.3.8 does more Gnome widgets, GtkImage, MenuItem label accelerator
    underlining, signal handlers now get ref to form and first styles (fonts)
    
version 0.3.5 (and greater) generates Gnome widgets but many are missing in the
    generally available Gtk-Perl (0.5121) :-(.

version 0.3.4 produces an OO class for each toplevel window/dialog. Thanks to 
    Robert Schwebel for many ideas and tests.

version 0.2.0 is the first 'stable' release. Bugfixes only in 0.2.x and
    development moves to 0.3.x versions.
