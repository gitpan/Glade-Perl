NEWS of Glade::PerlGenerate (GPG) Perl/Gtk-Glade UI builder and source generator
--------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW 'FEATURES'
--------------
version 0.41 implements Gnome::Druid stuff and also generates a working
    subclass with skeleton signal handler subs for you to copy and edit.
    We can now generate _all_ Glade widgets (and mostly correctly :-)
    
version 0.40 is the first CPAN release - hence the new version number format

version 0.3.14 is mainly a bugfix release with more useful values returned
    in the generated form constructors and some widgets packed properly now.
    
version 0.3.13 allows you to have a Gnome::App with some widgets in it! Some
    bug fixes from CVS versions of 19990922 and 19991001 are implemented and
    Gtk widget constructors split off from Glade::PerlUI into new module
    Glade::PerlUIGtk. Gnome enums looked up at run-time.

version 0.3.12 does most Gnome stuff now but you will need the CVS version
    after 19990922 to get the best from it. I have added a version dependancy
    checking so that older versions (eg Perl/Gtk 0.6123) will still work but 
    without the improvements and newer CVS builds can get at the improvements.
    
version 0.3.11 handles all widgets/properties that Perl/Gtk 0.6123 can handle
    as well as styles, although Glade cannot handle styles properly yet.
    Signals are now connected after the widgets are constructed.

version 0.3.8 does more Gnome widgets, GtkImage, MenuItem label accelerator
    underlining, signal handlers now get ref to form and first styles (fonts)
    
version 0.3.5 (and greater) generates Gnome widgets but many are missing in the
    generally available Perl/Gtk (0.5121) :-(.

version 0.3.4 produces an OO class for each toplevel window/dialog. Thanks to 
    Robert Schwebel for many ideas and tests.

version 0.2.0 is the first 'stable' release. Bugfixes only in 0.2.x and
    development moves to 0.3.x versions.
