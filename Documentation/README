Glade::PerlGenerate is a module that will read a Glade-Interface XML 
file, build the UI and/or write the perl source to create the UI later and
handle signals. It also creates an 'App' and an 'App subclass' that
you can edit and documentation and distribution files.

It is made up of two main packages. Glade::PerlGenerate does the clever 
stuff and Glade::PerlRun has some run-time utilities that are needed 
by Glade::PerlGenerate and also by your generated modules.
There are several support modules for PerlGenerate that read the XML, build the 
UI, write the source and handle the project options.

There are several options
1) Simply show and run the interface. Any missing signal handlers are
   hijacked to show a simple message box.

2) Write several perl class files. 
   A) ProjectUI.pm   - the UI constructor class
   B) ProjectSIGS.pm - utilities and skeleton signal handlers
   C) Project.pm     - a base for your app that you can edit
   D) SubProject.pm  - an example subclass of your app that you can edit
   
   If you specifiy &STDOUT as the output filename all the generated code will 
   be written to STDOUT but of course you will have nothing to run later.

3) Do both of the above.

4) Generate (2 above) from Glade's 'Build' button.

EDITING
-------
The source code is generated with tabs replacing spaces at the rate specified 
by the user option 'tabwidth' (default 8) so your editor should be set to the
same tabwidth if the generated source is to look correct.

Read the file test.pl for some examples of how to use Glade::PerlGenerate.

REQUIREMENTS (what I use but older versions work)

                        you probably worked this out while building Glade and 
                        Gtk-Perl :)
