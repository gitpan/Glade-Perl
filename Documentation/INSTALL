Glade::PerlGenerate (GPG) Gtk-Perl-Glade UI builder and source generator
--------------------------------------------------------------------
TO INSTALL
----------
There is a standard Makefile.PL to handle some checks and install the package

To install
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    su
    make install (if test was OK)
        
TO BUILD RPMS
-------------
Build the RPMs by calling
    rpm -ta Glade-Perl-0.58.tar.gz

TO INSTALL RPMS
---------------
Install the files by calling (default location on my Redhat based distro)
    rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/Glade-Perl-0.58-1.noarch.rpm


TO RUN FROM GLADE
-----------------
If you use Glade >= 0.5.0 you can set the project language to Perl and
Then when you click the 'Build' button or 'File/Build Source Code' menu item 
the supplied script (called 'glade2perl' and installed in a directory in 
your path) will generate Perl sources for you. 

Glade-Perl uses options files to store information about such things as 
existing signal handler modules and so on. This means that signal handler 
stubs are only specified if they are not available at Build time even though 
Glade knows nothing about them. This approach also allows you to control other 
options for the Glade build phase.

TO RUN MANUALLY
---------------
You need Perl, Glib/Gtk+, Gtk-Perl and XML::Parser packages and of course
Glade if you want to edit the interface files.

    glade2perl Project1.glade
    
Then to run the app:
    perl -e 'use src::Project1; window1->app_run'
OR  perl -e 'use src::SubProject1; Subwindow1->app_run'

(Obviously change the project name and window name to whatever you defined
in your Glade project)

To build a UI from an XML string. Look at the file $DIST_DIR/test.pl for an
example of doing this using a call to Glade::PerlGenerate->Form_from_XML to 
show a Glade UI.
