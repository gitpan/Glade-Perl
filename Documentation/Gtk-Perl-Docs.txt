Some notes on Perl/Gtk documentation

Firstly, make sure that you have the latest Perl/Gtk (version 0.6123). 
Older versions have too many errors and omissions.

The Perl/Gtk maintainers have started to document the bindings and if you
build Perl/Gtk yourself docs should be produced then. Examples of what is
produced are at
  http://www.lettere.unipd.it/~lupus/perl-gtk-ref.html
        for the reference manual of modules and functions, and
  http://www.lettere.unipd.it/~lupus/perl-gtk-ds.html
        for some data structures and types (currently enumerations and flags).

Pod versions of these files are in the Perl/Gtk build/ directory after calling 
'perl Makefile.PL' Call 
  'pod2html perl-gtk-ref.pod > perl-gtk-ref.html'
  'pod2html perl-gtk-ds.pod  > perl-gtk-ds.html'
to turn them into HTML files if you want.

Since Perl/Gtk mimics the toolkits so regularly, I use the
  Gtk+ documentation    
      gtk-docs-html-1.1.1 IIRC a tar.gz from gtk+ download site

  Gnome documentation   
      /usr/doc/gnome-libs-devel-1.0.8/devel-docs/ in my gnome-libs-devel
      rpm package or directory devel-docs/ in the CVS dir.

  Perl/Gtk distribution .xs files
  
  If you have the gtk+ sources, read the .[ch] files

All the source files are clearly named but the main confusion is likely
to come from the Perl/Gtk structure which is much more obviously object
oriented. For example, gtk_container_add is bound as Gtk::Container->add()
and this method is inherited by all containers. So, to add a widget to a
TreeItem that inherits as follows

 GtkObject
     +----GtkWidget
           +----GtkContainer
                 +----GtkBin
                       +----GtkItem
                             +----GtkTreeItem

you must get a ref $ti_ref to the TreeItem and then call $ti_ref->add()
rather than gtk_conatiner_add() as you would in C.

The file NOTES in Perl/Gtk also gives some programming guidelines and 
information about Perl/Gtk naming.
