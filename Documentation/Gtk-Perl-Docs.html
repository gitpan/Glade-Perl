    <h1>Some notes on Gtk-Perl documentation</h1>

    Firstly, make sure that you have the latest Gtk-Perl (or at the very least 
    version 0.6123). Older versions have too many errors and omissions.

    <p>There is documentation and software to download at the
    <a href="http://www.gtkperl.org/">Gtk-Perl homepage</a>
    <h2>HTML Tutorial</h2>

    Stephen Wilhelm &lt;swilhelm at theriver.com&gt; has pretty well finished 
    (10 June 2001) his excellent
    <a href="http://personal.riverusers.com/~swilhelm/gtkperl-tutorial/">
        online tutorial</a> 
    for Gtk-Perl. It follows the Gtk+ Tutorial style 
    and has some very pretty syntax highlighting for the code examples :)
    <p>
    You can download a tarball of the whole site from the tutorial homepage 
    so that you have a Gtk-Perl tutorial/manual for use when you are off-line.
    <p>
    I have learnt a lot from the tutorial and examples and I think that this 
    is the best way to start with Gtk-Perl. 
    
    <h2>Gtk-Perl package documentation</h2>
    If you need a complete reference of all the Gtk-Perl modules and their
    methods and data structures
    the Gtk-Perl maintainers have automated the building of documention for
    the bindings.
    and if you build Gtk-Perl yourself, up-to-date docs will be produced then.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Pod versions of the files are in the build/ directory of each module after 
    you have called 'perl Makefile.PL'. 
    <br>You can turn them into cross referenced HTML files by calling e.g.:
    <pre>
      pod2html perl-gtk-ref.pod > perl-gtk-ref.html
      pod2html perl-gtk-ds.pod  > perl-gtk-ds.html
    </pre>

    Online HTML examples of what is produced are 
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.gtkperl.org/reference.html">
            the reference manual of modules and functions and
            some data structures and types
            </a> (currently enumerations and flags).
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    You may be able to learn something from the Gtk-Perl distribution .xs files
    </li>
    <li>
    The file NOTES in Gtk-Perl also gives some programming guidelines and 
    information about Gtk-Perl naming.
    </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Other distribution and source files</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Gtk documentation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since Gtk-Perl mimics the toolkits so regularly, I use the
            Gtk+ documentation gtk-docs-html-1.1.1 IIRC a tar.gz from 
            the gtk+ download site. 
            <li>There is also a tutorial at 
            <a href="http://www.gtk.org/pub/gtk/tutorial/">www.gtk.org/pub/gtk/tutorial/</a>
            <li>If you have the gtk+ sources, read the .[ch] files
            All the source files are clearly named but the main confusion is likely
            to come from the Gtk-Perl structure which is much more obviously object
            oriented. For example, gtk_container_add is bound as Gtk::Container->add()
            and this method is inherited by all containers. So, to add a widget to a
            TreeItem that inherits as follows
            <pre>
             GtkObject
                 +----GtkWidget
                       +----GtkContainer
                             +----GtkBin
                                   +----GtkItem
                                         +----GtkTreeItem
            </pre>
            you must get a ref $ti_ref to the TreeItem and then call $ti_ref->add()
            rather than gtk_container_add() as you would in C.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <h3> </h3>
    <li>
        <h3>Gnome documentation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Again, if you have the gnome sources, read the .[ch] files
            <li>
            /usr/doc/gnome-libs-devel-1.2.4/devel-docs/ in my gnome-libs-devel
            rpm package or directory devel-docs/ in the source tree.
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

    A good source of information about using the Gtk-Perl bindings and Gtk 
    programming in general is the gtk-perl-list mailing list. You can 
    <a href="mailto:gtk-perl-list-request@redhat.com?subject=subscribe">
    subscribe</a>
    by sending an email to gtk-perl-list-request@redhat.com with a subject of 
    'subscribe' (without the quotes). Then follow the instructions that will be 
    emailed to you and confirm the request.
    <p>
    The gtk-perl-list grew out of 
    <a href="mailto:gtk-perl-list-request@redhat.com?subject=subscribe">
    gtk-list@redhat.com</a> and there is still plenty to learn from that 
    list too.

    <p>
    Please don't post long code examples or attachments and definitely no HTML :-) 
    Also use a meaningful subject line, 'How do I add text to a Gtk::List' 
    is much better than 'Help, I'm a newbie'

<h2>Glade-Perl</h2>
    Of course, the <a href="http://www.glade.perl.connectfree.co.uk/index.html">
    Glade-Perl homepage</a> has the latest documentation and useful links that 
    I know about.
