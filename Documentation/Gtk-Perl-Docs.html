<h1>Some notes on Gtk-Perl documentation</h1>

    Firstly, make sure that you have the latest Gtk-Perl (or at least 
    version 0.6123). Older versions have too many errors and omissions.

<h2>HTML</h2>

    Stephen Wilhelm <swilhelm@theriver.com> has finished 21 chapters 
    (14 April 2000) of his excellent
    <a href="http://personal.riverusers.com/~swilhelm/perlgtk/tutorial/">
    online Gtk-Perl tutorial</a> for Gtk-Perl. It follows the Gtk+ style 
    and has some very pretty syntax highlighting for the code examples :)

    <p>
    The Gtk-Perl maintainers have automated the building of documention for
    the bindings and if you build Gtk-Perl yourself docs should be produced 
    then. Examples of what is produced are the 
    <a href="http://www.lettere.unipd.it/~lupus/perl-gtk-ref.html">
        reference manual of modules and functions</a>, and 
    <a href="http://www.lettere.unipd.it/~lupus/perl-gtk-ds.html">
        some data structures and types</a>
    (currently enumerations and flags).

<h2>Gtk-Perl package documentation</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Pod versions of the files are in the build/ directory of each module after 
    you have called 'perl Makefile.PL'. 
    <br>You can turn them into cross referenced HTML files by calling e.g.:
    <pre>
      pod2html perl-gtk-ref.pod > perl-gtk-ref.html
      pod2html perl-gtk-ds.pod  > perl-gtk-ds.html
    </pre>

    </li>
    <li>
    You may be able to learn something from the Gtk-Perl distribution .xs files
    </li>
    <li>
    The file NOTES in Gtk-Perl also gives some programming guidelines and 
    information about Gtk-Perl naming.
    </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Distribution and source files</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Gtk documentation</h3>
        Since Gtk-Perl mimics the toolkits so regularly, I use the
        Gtk+ documentation gtk-docs-html-1.1.1 IIRC a tar.gz from 
        the gtk+ download site
        There is also a tutorial at www.gtk.org/pub/gtk/tutorial/
        <p>
        If you have the gtk+ sources, read the .[ch] files
        <p>
        All the source files are clearly named but the main confusion is likely
        to come from the Gtk-Perl structure which is much more obviously object
        oriented. For example, gtk_container_add is bound as Gtk::Container->add()
        and this method is inherited by all containers. So, to add a widget to a
        TreeItem that inherits as follows
        <pre>
         GtkObject
             +----GtkWidget
                   +----GtkContainer
                         +----GtkBin
                               +----GtkItem
                                     +----GtkTreeItem
        </pre>
        you must get a ref $ti_ref to the TreeItem and then call $ti_ref->add()
        rather than gtk_conatiner_add() as you would in C.
    </li>
    <h3> </h3>
    <li>
        <h3>Gnome documentation</h3>
        Again, if you have the gnome sources, read the .[ch] files
        <p>
            /usr/doc/gnome-libs-devel-1.0.8/devel-docs/ in my gnome-libs-devel
            rpm package or directory devel-docs/ in the CVS dir.
    </li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

    A good new source of information about using the Gtk-Perl bindings and Gtk 
    programming in general is the gtk-perl-list mailing list. You can 
    <a href="mailto:gtk-perl-list-request@redhat.com?subject=subscribe">
    subscribe</a>
    by sending an email to gtk-perl-list-request@redhat.com with a subject of 
    'subscribe' (without the quotes). Then follow the instructions that will be 
    emailed to you and confirm the request.
    <p>
    The gtk-perl-list grew out of 
    <a href="mailto:gtk-perl-list-request@redhat.com?subject=subscribe">
    gtk-list@redhat.com</a> and there is still plenty to learn from that 
    list too.

    <p>
    Please don't post long code examples or attachments and definitely no HTML :-) 
    Also use a meaningful subject line, 'How do I add text to a List in Gtk-Perl' 
    is much better than 'Help, I'm a newbie'
